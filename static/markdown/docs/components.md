# Components

There are 2 main types of components in the plugin:

* *BP Components* - think of them like property bags for entities.
* *Builtin Components*  - Pre-defined C++ structs

We'll talk about pre-defined components in detail in sections below, for now here is the list:

* Transform
* Render
* Animation

Yep, that's it.
