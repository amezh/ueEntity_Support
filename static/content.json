This property is not exposed to BP since rendering system will manage it for you.\nRender Components can be assigned to any Entity at any time and removed in any time. Entity will keep animating even if it's not rendering anymore.\nRendering system will be notified any time any Rendering component assigned or destroyed and will manage instances according to the situation.\nEntity can travel frely across the ISMs. Just remove one component and assign another one.\nFor example if your apple tree grew big enough and you want to swap it to another model - you can do that.\nOr if you have an unloaded truck and you want to change the model to loaded one - create two ISMs and travel your entity between them.\nYou can control Rendering mesh with the following:\nC++:\n`C++\nbool GetRendererComponent(int entityId, FRenderComponent& valueOut);\nbool SetRendererComponent(int entityId, FRenderComponent value);\nvoid DeleteRendererComponent(int entityId);\n`\nBP\nalt text","wordCount":172,"type":"Content"},{"name":"AnimationComponent","description":"Actually a few animation compoments","path":"/ueentity/docs/components/Animation","text":"","wordCount":0,"type":"Content"},{"name":"BPComponent","description":"aka whatever you want","path":"/ueentity/docs/components/BPCompoment","text":"","wordCount":0,"type":"Content"},{"name":"Systems","description":"Everything about Systems","path":"/ueentity/docs/systems","text":"","wordCount":0,"type":"Content"}]
